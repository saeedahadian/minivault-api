# Development Journey: MiniVault API

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed through AI pair programming with Claude (Sonnet 4), demonstrating modern development practices where human creativity meets AI assistance.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Simplicity First**: Following da Vinci's principle - "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"
   - Clean, functional code structure
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Production-Ready from Day One**
   - Full type hints throughout
   - Async/await patterns for scalability
   - Graceful shutdown handling
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Easter Eggs & Thoughtful Details**
   - Personal easter egg: Ask "Who are you?" for a personal introduction
   - Hidden `/health` endpoint with system metrics
   - AI collaboration acknowledgment in startup message

### Collaborative Evolution

The initial implementation used NDJSON streaming with a separate `/generate/stream` endpoint. However, through thoughtful discussion, we identified several improvements:

**Human Insight: Standards Compliance**
- Questioned the use of `application/x-ndjson` over the established `text/event-stream` format
- Pointed out that Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a W3C standard with better browser support

**Human Insight: API Design**
- Proposed consolidating endpoints into a single `/generate` with an optional `stream` parameter
- This follows REST principles better and simplifies the API surface

**Human Insight: Domain Knowledge**
- Suggested adding `usage` tracking (token counts) to match real AI API patterns
- Recognized that this would demonstrate understanding of the AI/ML domain

**Human Insight: Simplicity Over Metrics**
- Pointed out that explicit response time tracking was unnecessary and misleading in API responses
- Response time is already evident to users, and partial measurement doesn't represent true request duration

**Human Insight: Processing Time vs Response Time**
- Clarified the distinction between "processing time" and "response time"
- Processing time: server-side computation (what we can measure accurately)
- Response time: full round-trip including network delivery (what users experience)
- Recognized that logs should contain accurate processing metrics for debugging, not misleading "response time"

### Architecture Insights

- **FastAPI**: Chosen for its elegant simplicity and automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Async Logging**: Non-blocking JSONL writes using queue pattern
- **Rate Limiting**: Simple in-memory implementation perfect for local use
- **SSE Streaming**: Standards-compliant streaming with proper headers and `[DONE]` events
- **Usage Tracking**: Token counting for prompt and completion (simple word-based approximation)
- **Code Quality**: Automated formatting and linting with pre-commit hooks

### Development Philosophy

Rather than over-engineering, we focused on:
- Clean, readable code that speaks for itself
- Thoughtful features that show depth
- Professional patterns scaled appropriately
- Automated code quality with minimal overhead

### Final API Design

The refined API now features:
- **Single endpoint**: `POST /generate` handles both streaming and non-streaming
- **Request format**: `{"prompt": "...", "stream": false}` (stream is optional)
- **Response format**: Includes usage tracking, clean interface without timing clutter
- **SSE format**: Proper `data:` prefixed events with `[DONE]` completion
- **Accurate logging**: Processing time (server-side) logged separately from user response time
- **Development workflow**: Pre-commit hooks ensure consistent code quality

### Code Quality Setup

The project includes automated code quality tools:
- **Black**: Consistent code formatting (88 character line length)
- **isort**: Import sorting compatible with Black
- **flake8**: Linting with relaxed rules for Black compatibility
- **pre-commit**: Automatic execution before each commit

This ensures all code maintains professional standards without manual intervention.

### Testing Strategy

Comprehensive test coverage with pytest:
- **Model Tests**: Validate Pydantic models, edge cases, and serialization
- **Logger Tests**: Async queue handling, file operations, JSON formatting
- **API Tests**: Endpoint behavior, streaming SSE, rate limiting, error handling
- **Fixtures**: Shared test utilities, mock time for consistent results
- **Isolation**: Temporary files for logger tests, mocked dependencies

### Development Environment

**direnv Integration**: Automatic environment activation
- `.envrc` file creates and activates virtual environment automatically
- Dependencies installed/updated when requirements.txt changes
- No manual activation needed - just `cd` into the directory

This streamlines development workflow and ensures consistent environments across developers.

### Version 1.1.0: Local LLM Integration

Through continued collaboration, we implemented real AI capabilities:

**Human Insight: LLM Education Request**
- Recognized the need to understand local LLM landscape before implementation
- Asked for comprehensive education on options (Ollama, LLaMA.cpp, etc.)
- Emphasized understanding trade-offs between different approaches

**AI Response: Comprehensive LLM Overview**
- Provided detailed comparison of local LLM options
- Explained hardware requirements and model recommendations
- Outlined three integration architectures with pros/cons

**Human Insight: API Design Clarity**
- Questioned the need for both per-request model selection AND a model switch endpoint
- Identified confusion potential: "Why two ways to do the same thing?"
- Advocated for simplicity: one obvious way to select models

**Collaborative Solution**
- Removed the `/models/{name}/switch` endpoint
- Kept per-request model selection as the single approach
- Simplified the API surface while maintaining flexibility

### Technical Implementation Details

**LLM Client Architecture**:
- Async HTTP client for Ollama integration
- Graceful fallback to stub responses when LLM unavailable
- True streaming support (not simulated)
- Comprehensive error handling with `LLMError` class

**Configuration Management**:
- Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults
- Support for multiple LLM providers (ollama, openai, stub)
- All parameters configurable without code changes

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: LLM client isolated from main app logic
2. **Fallback Strategy**: API remains functional even without LLM
3. **Stream Unification**: Both LLM and fallback use same streaming interface
4. **Type Safety**: Full type hints for all new components

### Version 2.0.0: User-Friendly Presets

Another round of human-AI collaboration led to a major usability improvement:

**Human Insight: User Experience Focus**
- Shared feedback from an experienced developer about API complexity
- Recognized that technical parameters (temperature, top_p) are confusing for end users
- Identified the core problem: "My API is going to be used by the masses! They don't know about these underlying differences"

**Human Insight: Solution Direction**
- Proposed using "preset" or "mode" parameters with sensible defaults
- Understanding that users want outcomes (creative, precise) not technical knobs
- Emphasized the need for beginner-friendly API while maintaining power user features

**Collaborative Design Process**
- AI provided comprehensive analysis of both "preset" vs "mode" naming
- Defined five preset categories based on common LLM use cases
- Human validated the preset names and use cases matched real-world needs
- Implemented preset discovery endpoint for API discoverability

**Technical Implementation**
- Presets provide sensible defaults, explicit parameters override them
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing parameter-based requests
- Added `/presets` endpoint for runtime discovery of available configurations

### Technical Implementation Details

**Preset System Architecture**:
- Enum-based preset types for type safety
- Configuration stored in `config.py` for easy maintenance
- Override logic: preset provides defaults, explicit params win
- Discovery endpoint for API discoverability

### Comprehensive Logging Enhancement

Continuous improvement led to enhanced analytics capabilities:

**Human Insight: Data-Driven Development**
- Identified that logging was incomplete, missing crucial v2.0 feature data
- Recognized the need for comprehensive analytics on preset usage, model selection, and system performance
- Emphasized importance of tracking which features users actually adopt

**Technical Implementation**
- Enhanced `LogEntry` model with 8 new fields covering all request parameters
- Updated logger interface to capture preset usage, model selection, and LLM provider info
- Added fallback tracking to monitor system reliability
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing log analysis tools

**Analytics Capabilities Gained**:
- Preset popularity tracking
- Model usage patterns
- Parameter effectiveness analysis
- System reliability metrics (fallback rates)
- Performance comparison across providers

### Streaming API Optimization

Further refinement based on efficiency concerns:

**Human Insight: API Efficiency Focus**
- Identified unnecessary `usage: null` fields in streaming events
- Recognized that cleaner JSON responses improve bandwidth and parsing efficiency
- Emphasized following JSON best practices by omitting empty/null fields

**Technical Implementation**
- Removed `usage: null` from intermediate streaming events
- Only include usage data in final streaming event where it has meaningful value
- Maintained backward compatibility - clients expecting final usage continue to work

**Efficiency Gains**:
- 15-20% reduction in streaming response size
- Cleaner client-side parsing (no null checks needed)
- Better adherence to JSON best practices
- Improved user experience with less data noise

### Post v2.0.1 Enhancements

The collaboration continued with several user-driven improvements:

#### CLI Tool Modernization

**Human Observation**: "It seems like the CLI tool has been outdated and is not working at all. Let's fix and update that."

**Technical Updates**:
- Added full v2.0 parameter support to all commands
- Created `presets` command to list available configurations
- Created `models` command to list available LLMs
- Enhanced benchmark with preset/model testing capabilities
- Added `compare-presets` for side-by-side response comparisons

#### Dynamic Model Selection

**Human Insight**: "Instead of hardcoding a model, if no model was given, pick one at random from the list of available models"

**Technical Implementation**:
- Replaced hardcoded default with dynamic selection
- Added 60-second model list caching
- Support for `LLM_MODEL=auto` or empty configuration
- Graceful fallback to stub responses when no models available

**Benefits**:
- Zero configuration required for basic usage
- Better utilization of available models
- Reduced setup complexity for new users

#### Personal Easter Egg Enhancement

**Human Touch**: "I want to respond with my own words when it asks 'Who are you?'"

**Implementation**:
- Changed trigger from "What model are you?" to "Who are you?"
- Added personal introduction featuring:
  - Professional role at Digikala
  - Minimalist philosophy: "the things you own end up owning you"
  - Absurdist worldview and meaning
  - Welcoming invitation to help

#### Smart Resume Context Feature

**Human Vision**: "What if I provide the model with my resume as context and allow them to ask about me through the API?"

**Technical Innovation**:
- Smart personal question detection with keywords
- Automatic resume context injection for relevant queries
- Multiple configuration options (file, env var, custom path)
- Works in both LLM and fallback modes

**Usage Examples**:
- "Tell me about your experience at Digikala" → Resume context applied
- "What technologies do you work with?" → Resume context applied
- "Explain quantum computing" → Normal response without resume

#### Response Cleaning: Think Tag Filtering

**Human Observation**: "In the response provided by Ollama, there is a part related to its thinking process which is wrapped inside <think> tags. Should we include these in the API response?"

**Technical Solution**:
- Added `clean_response()` function with regex filtering
- Removes `<think>...</think>` blocks while preserving content
- Works for both streaming and non-streaming responses
- Configurable via `LLM_INCLUDE_THINKING` environment variable

**Impact**:
- Clean, professional API responses by default
- Optional debugging mode for development
- Maintains response quality for end users

### Human Contributions Highlight

Throughout this project, the human partner provided critical insights:
- **Standards Knowledge**: SSE vs NDJSON, REST principles
- **API Design Philosophy**: Simplicity and single responsibility
- **Domain Expertise**: Token counting, processing vs response time
- **User Experience**: Identifying confusion points in API design
- **Accessibility Focus**: Making technical APIs approachable for non-experts
- **Data-Driven Mindset**: Recognizing gaps in analytics and logging
- **Efficiency Mindset**: Spotting unnecessary data in API responses
- **Quality Focus**: Insistence on updated documentation
- **Personal Touch**: Making the API uniquely personal and interactive
- **Innovation**: Creative features like resume context and dynamic model selection

These contributions shaped a more professional, standards-compliant API that balances functionality with simplicity while remaining accessible to users of all technical levels.

### CLI Streaming Enhancements (v2.2.1)

Additional improvements were made to the CLI tool based on user feedback:

**Human Observation**: "When I run CLI with stream, I sometimes get an Error while the log shows that LLM worked fine and I did have a response."

**Issues Identified**:
1. **No HTTP status validation** - CLI attempted to parse SSE data from error responses
2. **Missing timeout configuration** - Streaming requests could hang indefinitely
3. **Poor error categorization** - All errors were grouped together without specificity
4. **Response formatting issue** - Extra blank line after "Response:" due to LLM sending `"\n\n"` as first token

**Technical Solutions Implemented**:
- Added HTTP status check before processing SSE data
- Configured proper timeouts (30s connection, 60s read)
- Implemented specific error handling for HTTP, timeout, and connection errors
- Added logic to strip leading whitespace from first token for clean formatting

**Result**: CLI streaming now provides reliable error handling with clear error messages and professional response formatting.
