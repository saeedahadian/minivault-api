# Development Journey: MiniVault API

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed through AI pair programming with Claude (Sonnet 4), demonstrating modern development practices where human creativity meets AI assistance.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Simplicity First**: Following da Vinci's principle - "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"
   - Clean, functional code structure
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Production-Ready from Day One**
   - Full type hints throughout
   - Async/await patterns for scalability
   - Graceful shutdown handling
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Easter Eggs & Thoughtful Details**
   - Meta-prompt handling: Ask "What model are you?" for a surprise
   - Hidden `/health` endpoint with system metrics
   - AI collaboration acknowledgment in startup message

### Collaborative Evolution

The initial implementation used NDJSON streaming with a separate `/generate/stream` endpoint. However, through thoughtful discussion, we identified several improvements:

**Human Insight: Standards Compliance**
- Questioned the use of `application/x-ndjson` over the established `text/event-stream` format
- Pointed out that Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a W3C standard with better browser support

**Human Insight: API Design**
- Proposed consolidating endpoints into a single `/generate` with an optional `stream` parameter
- This follows REST principles better and simplifies the API surface

**Human Insight: Domain Knowledge**
- Suggested adding `usage` tracking (token counts) to match real AI API patterns
- Recognized that this would demonstrate understanding of the AI/ML domain

**Human Insight: Simplicity Over Metrics**
- Pointed out that explicit response time tracking was unnecessary and misleading in API responses
- Response time is already evident to users, and partial measurement doesn't represent true request duration

**Human Insight: Processing Time vs Response Time**
- Clarified the distinction between "processing time" and "response time"
- Processing time: server-side computation (what we can measure accurately)
- Response time: full round-trip including network delivery (what users experience)
- Recognized that logs should contain accurate processing metrics for debugging, not misleading "response time"

### Architecture Insights

- **FastAPI**: Chosen for its elegant simplicity and automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Async Logging**: Non-blocking JSONL writes using queue pattern
- **Rate Limiting**: Simple in-memory implementation perfect for local use
- **SSE Streaming**: Standards-compliant streaming with proper headers and `[DONE]` events
- **Usage Tracking**: Token counting for prompt and completion (simple word-based approximation)

### Development Philosophy

Rather than over-engineering, we focused on:
- Clean, readable code that speaks for itself
- Thoughtful features that show depth
- Professional patterns scaled appropriately

### Final API Design

The refined API now features:
- **Single endpoint**: `POST /generate` handles both streaming and non-streaming
- **Request format**: `{"prompt": "...", "stream": false}` (stream is optional)
- **Response format**: Includes usage tracking, clean interface without timing clutter
- **SSE format**: Proper `data:` prefixed events with `[DONE]` completion
- **Accurate logging**: Processing time (server-side) logged separately from user response time

### Future Enhancements Considered

- Integration with local LLMs (Ollama/Hugging Face)
- Metrics export (Prometheus format)
- Request ID tracking for debugging
- Configuration management via environment variables
